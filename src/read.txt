I am building a full professional website for my coding internship program called **CodeCatalysta**. It is aimed at high school and early college students who want real-world experience in software development, mentorship, and impactful coding projects. I am using React (with Create React App) and I want this site to be coded cleanly, without any UI frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind. Just use CSS modules or clean scoped styling.

Please create a full multi-page React site with the following structure and content:

---

### 🏠 Home Page ("/")
This is the first thing visitors see. The goal is to make a strong first impression and get people to click “Apply Now.”

**Sections:**
- **Hero section** with a bold headline like: “Launch Your Coding Career with CodeCatalysta”
  - Subheading: “A remote-first, project-based internship for future developers and changemakers.”
  - CTA button: “Apply Now” → links to `/apply`
  - Background image or animation
- **What We Offer** section with 3 icons:
  - Real-world coding projects
  - Weekly mentorship from industry experts
  - Career readiness & portfolio building
- **Stats section**:
  - 3K+ Hours of Code Written
  - 95% Intern Satisfaction
  - 100+ Past Interns
- **Testimonial slider** (use sample testimonials)
- **Partner logos**: (GitHub, Replit, Notion, Firebase, etc.)
